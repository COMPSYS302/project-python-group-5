# Project Python
 This application is a machine learning model built as a part of COMPSYS 302's course requirements, the model is capable of recognising and interpreting standard American Sign Language excluding J and Z. The machine learning models are trained on the SIGN MNIST dataset. The application features 3 seperate models available: ResNet, AlexNet and a custom built CNN model and support training and testing of all models as well as live camera capture.
 
 # Usage
 To run the application install PyTorch, PyQt5, pandas, OpenCV, mediapipe and NumPy using conda.
 Once the correct packages are installed run main.py and the application should open. On the main application page you have the ability to test and train the seperate models as well as upload your dataset and view the images from your dataset. Image view and model training is only available once a valid dataset(.csv) has been uploaded and testing is only available once you have a trained model available locally within the project directory either by training or by importing a seperately trained model.
